# Test Coverage Improvements

## Current Status
The test coverage report shows low coverage for several components, especially in the `devices` section:

- `DeviceDetails.js`: 7.4%
- `DeviceExportImport.js`: 0%
- `DeviceTable.js`: 0%
- `ImportResultModal.js`: 0%

## Improvements Made

### DeviceDetails.js
1. Fixed critical bugs:
   - Replaced incorrect `window.rack_number.href` with proper `navigate` function
   - Added proper error handling for API calls
   - Used React Router's navigate function instead of directly manipulating window.location

2. Added comprehensive tests:
   - Normal case: Displaying device details with all fields
   - Error case: Handling API errors
   - Error case: Handling null/empty responses
   - UI interactions: Verifying edit/back buttons and links
   - Delete functionality: Testing modal display and confirmation

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

### General Testing Approach
1. Create mock data for all components in a centralized location
2. Setup proper testing utilities to handle React Router components
3. Establish consistent patterns for testing async operations and UI interactions

### DeviceExportImport.js
1. Create tests for file selection validation
2. Mock the import/export API calls
3. Test the confirmation modal flow
4. Test error handling for API failures

### DeviceTable.js
1. Test the rendering of table rows and columns
2. Test sorting functionality
3. Test pagination if implemented
4. Test any filtering capabilities

### ImportResultModal.js
1. Test rendering with different result states
2. Test proper display of success and error messages
3. Test the closing behavior

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with components that have dependencies on common components
2. Create simplified test versions that focus on core functionality
3. Gradually add more complex test scenarios
4. Integrate with CI/CD to ensure test coverage doesn't decrease

By following these recommendations, we can significantly improve the test coverage and ensure the application's reliability.
