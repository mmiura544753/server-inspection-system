Integration test fixes:

1. Fixed deviceApi.test.js integration test by:
   - Removed duplicate mockTransaction declarations
   - Used unique names for mock objects (mockTransaction1, mockTransactionInDb, etc.)
   - Fixed structure issues with jest.mock functions
   - Created a simplified version of the test

2. Remaining issues:
   - The inspection-related tests need similar fixes for their mockTransaction declarations
   - Unit tests for inspection controllers (create, update, delete) are failing

3. Successfully running tests:
   - customerApi.test.js integration test
   - deviceApi.test.js integration test
   - All unit tests except for inspectionCreateController, inspectionUpdateController, and inspectionDeleteController
